Highly configurable, and performant. Includes the following features:
- Configurable colors based on distance and depth.
- Edge foam.
- Sun specular highlights.
- Sparkles.
- Refraction based on depth.
- Foam on wave tips.
- Subsurface scattering (on wave tips facing the sun).
- Cubemap-based reflections.
- Vertex-based waves.

Edge foam, sparkles, foam, and reflections are comparatively more expensive than the other effects, and can be toggled on/off to increase performance.

Apply the included materials to Unity's default `Plane` object, or your own higher resolution one.

Also includes a simpler variant meant for upside-down `Plane` objects, to simulate looking up while under water (see last screenshot).
